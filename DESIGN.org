- prompt text has higher precedence than transformations
  - It's essentially annotated
- recursive descent
  - prompts inside prompts

This is for prompt templates, which is a far hackier way of building prompts
than examplary.

* TODO Design a reversible programming language
It *can* be entirely fictional/imaginary, but I must be be designing it with as
many features as I can possibly include.

- functional reversibility
  - Somehow, I need to be able to describe reversibly prompts, even if that
    process
  - means prompting for the reverse.
