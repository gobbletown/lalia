- prompt text has higher precedence than transformations
  - It's essentially annotated
- recursive descent
  - prompts inside prompts

This is for prompt templates, which is a far hackier way of building prompts
than examplary.

* TODO Design a reversible programming language
It *can* be entirely fictional/imaginary, but I must be be designing it with as
many features as I can possibly include.

- functional reversibility
  - Somehow, I need to be able to describe reversible prompts, even if that
    process

- style transfer

    - The idea is to put NL into a canonical form
      - Though, this could be prolog, for instance
